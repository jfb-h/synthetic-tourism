  abstract = {Offshore outsourcing, the corporate practice of “shipping jobs overseas,” is predicated on the principle of labor arbitrage, the exploitation of geographical differentials in the cost and control of labor. With its origins in the 1970s, and the relocation of blue‐collar jobs from North America and Western Europe to lower‐cost locations in Latin America and Eastern Europe, “offshoring” would later spread to services and knowledge‐based occupations, prompting the rise of back‐office and call‐center economies in India, the Philippines, and elsewhere. In the global north, the vantage point from which offshoring is seen, its cultural connotations are almost entirely negative, in light of enduring associations with job loss and economic insecurity. Neither a singular event, nor a unidirectional phenomenon, offshore outsourcing is a relational and transformative process; it continues to coevolve with the restructuring of “onshore” economies through sociotechnical and organizational change.},

  abstract = {Despite of the growth of the body of scholarly literature on the topic star architecture, few articles cite publications of architectural research on the topic. The scholarly discussion of star architecture is only marginally influenced by the problematizations specific to the architecture field. This paper presents findings of a systematic quantitative literature review of the topic star architecture. By searching Scopus and Avery databases using relevant keywords, a total of 365 English language articles published between 1997 and 2019 were identified. Following the analysis of titles, abstracts and keywords of these articles as well as the affiliations of authors, we categorized these articles according to their fields of research, types of research and applied research methods. Our findings indicate that the theoretical and methodological foundations of research on star architecture within the field of architecture are weak if compared to all other fields of study. Despite the significant number of articles within the architecture field, more than half of these articles do not receive any citations. Our findings confirm that the voices and perspectives of the architecture field contribute only marginally to the scholarly discussion of star architecture.},
