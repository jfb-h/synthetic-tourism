  abstract = {Offshore outsourcing, the corporate practice of “shipping jobs overseas,” is predicated on the principle of labor arbitrage, the exploitation of geographical differentials in the cost and control of labor. With its origins in the 1970s, and the relocation of blue‐collar jobs from North America and Western Europe to lower‐cost locations in Latin America and Eastern Europe, “offshoring” would later spread to services and knowledge‐based occupations, prompting the rise of back‐office and call‐center economies in India, the Philippines, and elsewhere. In the global north, the vantage point from which offshoring is seen, its cultural connotations are almost entirely negative, in light of enduring associations with job loss and economic insecurity. Neither a singular event, nor a unidirectional phenomenon, offshore outsourcing is a relational and transformative process; it continues to coevolve with the restructuring of “onshore” economies through sociotechnical and organizational change.},
