Efforts to emulate the so-called Bilbao effect followed internationally. However, not every city that commissions the design of a public cultural building to a star architect seeks to replicate that effect. This overarching narrative has nevertheless constituted a powerful background representation. This paper discusses the supposed replicability of the `effect'. The aim is to emphasize relational situatedness and plurality of roles of star architecture as a device of urban regeneration. The process of repositioning of a city does not necessarily follow the logic of international economic competition. When it comes to mediumsized cities, we observe that they aim at distinction within a specific field, in their nation-state, or try to reinvent their internal dynamics. This process can have expressive and symbolic, not merely instrumental character, and be understood as more of a socio-cultural performance rather than a purely economic investment. We juxtapose three empirical cases to illustrate the argument: Kunsthaus in Graz, Culture and Congress Centre Lucerne and Phaeno Science Centre in Wolfsburg.},

Even during the inception phase, a constellation of actors legitimizes these projects by capitalizing on their power to attract media attention. The media play a role in the communication and construction of narratives. This paper shows how newspaper narratives about a proposed star architecture project along the waterfront of a port city communicate transformation proposals. The case study presented is the inception phase of the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, Germany. The findings are based on content analysis of 420 newspaper articles, published before the formal endorsement of the project. The findings indicate that newspapers communicated the sense-making value of the Elbphilharmonie based on the visual and emotional power of star architecture. Newspapers introduced notions of identity, citizen identification and Hanseatic particularity into the discourse and played an important role in explaining the promise of the Elbphilharmonie to become a symbol of the city's commitment to the port, the maritime context and the Elbe river.},

By searching Scopus and Avery databases using relevant keywords, a total of 365 English language articles published between 1997 and 2019 were identified. Following the analysis of titles, abstracts and keywords of these articles as well as the affiliations of authors, we categorized these articles according to their fields of research, types of research and applied research methods. Our findings indicate that the theoretical and methodological foundations of research on star architecture within the field of architecture are weak if compared to all other fields of study. Despite the significant number of articles within the architecture field, more than half of these articles do not receive any citations. Our findings confirm that the voices and perspectives of the architecture field contribute only marginally to the scholarly discussion of star architecture.},

In this special issue of `European Planning Studies', we focus on star architecture and its ability to contribute to urban transformation, with articles on the phenomenon of star architecture from a range of disciplines. Star architecture is a topic where concerns about place, identity, economy, innovation and communication intersect. In this introduction to the special issue, we overview how star architecture participates in urban transformations, and address how research into star architecture connects to ideas of identity and branding, the media, the economy, urban governance and architecture itself. We also overview methodologies for studying star architecture and urban transformation: the choice of research methods and research approach affects the problematization and the types of research questions that can be answered. Studying star architecture offers insight into disparate fields including network analysis, media studies, geography, planning, cultural economy, identity, branding and spectacle. By looking beyond economic effects, researchers can expand the audience for studies of star architecture, and more fully understand its role in urban transformation.},

However, the empirical literature on the actual ex-post effects of this transport mode is scarce. This paper contributes to this line of research by estimating the causal impact of the HSR on the number of visitors in three small cities located in low-density areas in Spain. Our results, using the synthetic control method, robustly show that the expost causal effects of the HSR on overnight visitors are insignificant and, if any, they seem to exert a negative influence rather than a positive contribution. This suggests that smaller cities should be very cautious about the short-run expected impacts of transport improvements, and policy makers and planners should be aware of the actual contribution of such investments in their assessment of the net social benefits of HSR projects.},

Pushed by a range of actors, ``best practice'' examples are being copied from place to place around the globe. Flagship buildings are accompanied by a discourse of place branding that stresses a need for cities to improve their attractiveness. Drawing on this discourse and ongoing discussions on deterritorialization and reterritorialization in urban and economic geography, the author argues that there is an overly deterritorialized approach to flagship buildings in the place-branding literature. Using a conceptual framework inspired by the reterritorialization debate, she introduces the concept of ``flagship space,'' emphasizing a dualism in place branding encompassing both deterritorialized and territorial processes that in interplay create best-practice examples. The empirical analysis examines the development of five flagship hotels in Sweden. The author concludes that the five hotels have both created and are constantly reproducing their statuses as flagship developments. However, the creation and reproduction of status is not only upheld by the operators of the hotels but is also a joint effort of actors in the local community. Through these processes and practices the understanding of the hotels is broadened from merely being flagship buildings to creators of flagship space.},

Nonetheless, the locally specific geographies of governmental rationalities and technologies often remain vague and inexplicit, although they have a profound impact on the powerful processes of iconic architectural production. This aspect can be made particularly clear with regard to the case study of Hamburg's Elbe Philharmonic Hall -- the new iconic concert hall on Hamburg's redeveloped waterfront. Thus, the case study on hand emphasises the locally distinct ways in which place-specific `arts of government' are tied to contemporary processes of neoliberal urbanisation. Drawing on the Foucauldian notion of governmentality, the paper first lays open the contingent rationalities of the Elbe Philharmonic Hall project and discloses how fundamental transformations within geopolitical and geo-economic discourses gave rise to local policy objectives that emphasise the need to translate Hamburg's urban change into an `adequate' urbanistic shape. Second, the paper reflects on how place-specific discourses and practices of civic commitment and patronage become instrumentalised for the public legitimation and political enforcement of the project and thus become integral parts of a post-political regime of neoliberal governmentality.},

  abstract = {This commentary provides a short review of the history and current state of transition studies, and explores how a deepened exchange with economic geographers could be fostered at the geography of sustainability transitions interface along three fronts. First, we argue that a combined transitions--economic geography perspective allows elucidating how the coevolution of technologies, institutions, and actor networks creates multiscalar and spatially uneven opportunity spaces for transformative change. Second, it provides a deeper process-based understanding of structural change trajectories, emphasizing the social construction of material and institutional elements and their alignment into socio-technical configurations that work in addressing wicked sustainability problems. Third, it creates novel inroads for conceptualizing---and critically questioning---normative, policy-related concerns around how to achieve more just, resilient, and environmentally sustainable futures. The article concludes with epistemological and strategic considerations on how to further advance geography of transitions perspectives.},

Given the impact of the recent pandemic, this may prove to be an important predictor of tourism recovery in countries that are still struggling to recover, including South Africa. The purpose of this paper is firstly, to build on previous research that indicates that Google Trends improves tourism-demand forecasting by testing this within the context of tourism recovery. Secondly, this paper extends previous research by not only including Google Trends in time-series forecasting models but also typical tourism-demand covariates in an econometric specification. Finally, we test the performance of Google Trends in forecasting over a longer time period, because the destination country is a long-haul destination where more lead time may be required in decision-making. Additionally, this research contributes to the body of knowledge by including lower frequency data (quarterly) instead of the higher frequency data commonly used in current research, while also focusing on an important destination country in Africa. Due to the differing data frequencies, the MIDAS modelling approach is used. The MIDAS models are compared to typical time-series and na{\"i}ve benchmarks. The findings show that monthly Google Trends improve forecasts on lower frequency data. Furthermore, forecasts that include Google Trends are more effective in forecasting one to two quarters ahead, pre-COVID. This trend changed after COVID, when Google Trends led to improved recovery forecasts even over a longer term.},

This analysis examines the economic ramifications of an intra-metropolitan area relocation of Atlanta's professional baseball team from a traditional standalone downtown stadium to a new stadiumanchored mixed-use development in suburban Cobb County. Using the synthetic control method, the study employs metro-Atlanta counties to construct a counterfactual outcome for estimating changes in sales tax revenue after the ballpark opened. The findings indicate a net increase in taxable sales in the county; however, the magnitude of the effect is small and not statistically significant. Though net new spending is evident, approximately one-third of the project's sales appear to derive from crowding out other local economic activity. In total, added tax collections fall well short of covering the public subsidies provided by Cobb. The stadium's limited economic impact, despite its favorable location and ancillary mixed-use development, further supports past findings that sports venues are poor investments as economic development projects.},

Furthermore, this article will focus on the way tourism can lead local actors in cities to go even further and to continue to build their architecture, even after the death of the architects.

This article aims to present and discuss how architectural heritage can be produced and transformed `for' and `by' tourism, a fascinating change in these cities which has also been the subject of criticism and leads to many questions.},

Our findings identify three types of influence that the SAT building has on the field of projection mapping: supporting the community, fostering interorganisational relationships, and catalysing innovation. These influences manifest in distinct ways depending on the field's evolution phase. We contribute to the literature on field configuration by developing the concept of the field-configuring place and distinguishing it from the established concept of the field-configuring event. Additionally, we extend the institutional dynamics literature by showing how a place can support the configuration of a field from its emergence, based on its characteristics that can be adapted while providing stability. This study thus underlines the cross-fertilisation between the literature on field configuration and that on places.},

Yet because of the methodological challenges related to the identification of a counterfactual when a single unit is treated, the causal effects of these policies on the growth of the industry, or specifically on employment, are seldom identified. We adopt a Synthetic Control Method (SCM) approach to analyze the long-term impact on employment of the Tourism Development Policy (TDP) implemented by the Argentinean province of Salta. We find an 11 percent average annual impact over 10 years on employment in the hospitality sector, which translated in an accumulated impact of 1376 formal jobs in the tourism valuechain. We also find that this growth did not happen at the expenses of other industries and that TDP generated positive inter-industry employment spillovers/externalities. For each job created in the tourism value-chain, an additional job was created in the rest of the provincial economy, which resulted in a total creation of 2750 formal jobs. Our results are robust across a series of placebo tests and sensitivity checks and are consistent among alternative synthetic control units.},

The bias comes from matching to idiosyncratic error terms (noise) in the treated unit and the donor units' pre-treatment outcome values. This in turn leads to a biased counterfactual for the post-treatment periods. We use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the determinants of the bias in terms of error term variance, sample characteristics and DGP complexity, providing guidance as to which situations are likely to yield more bias. We also offer a procedure to reduce the bias using a direct computational bias-correction procedure based on re-sampling from a pilot model that can reduce the bias in empirically feasible implementations. As a final potential solution, we compare the performance of our corrections to that of an Interactive Fixed Effects model. An empirical application focused on trade liberalization indicates that the magnitude of the bias may be economically meaningful in a real world setting.},

  abstract = {The cultural heritage of capital cities is a local capital in the global competition for tourism income as well as a public good of urban societies and a symbol of national identities. When developing cultural heritage as an asset for tourism, city marketing turns these complex urban meanings into rather simplistic commercial images. Such symbolic manipulations of culture intervene in deeply affective, institutionalised structures and thus risk political conflict and public contention. The strongly controversial planning for the cultural flagship district of the Museumsquartier Vienna highlighted cultural diversity as an urban characteristic that remains often underweighted in urban political economy's focus on corporate dominance or local community. Enquiring into the discursive--institutional interactions which turned the political economic repositioning of urban culture into a plural political process, what lessons can we draw for tourism planning? As democratic societies meet diverse contemporary challenges in addition to tourism, managing the cultural heritage of cities is indeed a highly sensitive and controversial political task. But what initially appeared a planning failure and even deadlock of democratic government has since emerged as an urban space that is rather well accepted by local and international visitors. In the context of Vienna's international opening as a European capital, the controversial political emergence has contributed to constructing this cultural district as new interpretation of the historic city. Despite many shortcomings, unsolved conflicts and exclusionary decisions, the new landmark offers a specific combination of external images with internal visions, old paths with contemporary needs. Thus, instead of a rigid top-down plan, tourism planning needs to continuously consider diverse social, economic and political claims in an inclusive, differentiated and open-ended approach to urban development.},

However, as many projects do not achieve the set goals, their role as catalysts for urban development is debatable. We argue that the temporal and spatial economic dimension of the effects of star architecture projects -- which are hardly discussed in existing literature -- is crucial to assess the contribution of such projects for urban regeneration. The Kunsthaus Graz in Austria serves as a case study where we apply and modify the approach of the `spatial incidence analysis' to assess the socioeconomic and intertemporal effects of a publicly funded, star architecture project. The spatial incidence analysis is closely related to the cost-benefit analysis, but takes into consideration wider aspects of the spatial distribution and intertemporal development of three dimensions of effects: payment flows, goods and services, and utility. We identify the following key findings by applying a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods: the operation of the Kunsthaus Graz provides an inflow of purchasing power for the municipality of Graz; the Kunsthaus Graz has positive, long-term effects in the fields of tourism marketing, civic pride and identification, creative industries and urban regeneration; the effects of the Kunsthaus Graz are spatially concentrated in the municipality of Graz.},

In this paper, we focus on technical innovations triggered by star architecture and the effects that these innovations generate across the construction supply chain. Looking closely into the process of implementing the glass fa{\c c}ade of Hamburg's Elbphilharmonie, we maintain that ambitious design forces involved actors in developing innovative solutions to secure the realization of this exceptional design at all. At the same time yet, the ambitious design leads to highly selective processes. First, regarding the selection of involved actors, only a few specialized firms worldwide are able to accomplish the required ambitious design. And second, as in consequence, only these few actors benefit from the projects by accumulating experience, knowledge, reputation and stabilizing cooperation networks. The selectivity also embraces the geography of this ecology as the same networks of specialized firms tend to carry on innovations from star architecture project to another on an international scale.},

Most of these are individual case studies that focus on single effects, treating star architecture projects as monolithic entities. Furthermore, they fail to explain which precise aspects of these projects generate effects, so it remains unclear how they ``work''. We have applied a conceptual impact model to two case studies -- the Culture and Convention Centre in Lucerne (KKL) and the Phaeno Science Centre in Wolfsburg and divided the projects into four outputs: the building, the function, the offerings of star architec\- ture, and the actor-network, to analyse how these outputs generate socio-cultural, touristic and urban regeneration effects. The paper demonstrates that the different outputs of the projects produce a case-specific set of effects. Despite the differences between the two projects, the paper identifies common patterns of how star architecture projects generate effects.},

Focusing on buildings designed by winners of the Pritzker Prize and the Gold Medal awarded by the American Institute of Architects, we create a sample of commercial office buildings designed by signature architects, drawing on CoStar's comprehensive national database. We use a combination of hedonic regression model and a logit model to estimate the various price determinants. The results of the hedonic analysis suggest that, compared with buildings in the same submarket, office buildings designed by signature architects have rents that are 5\%--7\% higher, and sell for prices 17\% higher. The results from the second-stage logit estimation suggest a rental premium of approximately 5\% for signature architects in large architectural practices, while the sales-price premium identified in the first stage hedonic regression was not confirmed.},

This has led some researchers to dismiss the search for causes as ``cocktail party chatter'' that is outside the realm of science. We argue here that the search for causes can be understood within traditional statistical frameworks as a part of model checking and hypothesis generation. We argue that it can make sense to ask questions about the causes of effects, but the answers to these questions will be in terms of effects of causes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Synthetic Control Method (SCM) has become a widely used tool in both identifying and estimating the causal impact of policies, shocks, and interventions of interest on economic and social outcomes. The technique has become particularly popular in estimating the effect of these shocks on a single treated unit. As a transparent and data-driven statistical technique, the goal of the SCM is to construct an artificial control group for the treated unit that has similar pretreatment characteristics but has not undergone the treatment itself thus developing a plausible counterfactual against which impacts resulting from structural changes can be evaluated as part of a historical investigation. The method works well when the control group balances pre-intervention outcomes and auxiliary covariates as much as possible. In spite of its widespread adoption, the use of the SCM in comparative economic history has lagged behind other areas of economics. In this article, we critically review the properties of the SCM and discuss the necessary conditions for a plausible application of the technique to comparative economic history in support of research designed to answer some of the long-running historical questions and demonstrate the potential to use SCM in comparative economic history studies by estimating the impact of the oil discovery in the 1920s on Venezuela's long-term economic growth.},

Two years into the pandemic, countries continue to struggle with fifth and sixth waves, new virus variants, and varying degrees of success in vaccinating national populations. Travel restrictions continue to persist, and the global tourism industry looks into a third year of uncertainty. There is a consensus that the COVID crisis should be a turning point, to ``build back better'', and that a return to pre-pandemic overtourism phenomena is undesirable. Yet, there is very limited evidence that the crisis has changed or will change tourism beyond the micro-scale. In regard to many issues, such as new debt, global tourism has become more vulnerable. Against the background of the climate crisis, the purpose of this paper is to take stock: Which lessons can be learned from the pandemic for global warming? To achieve this, relevant papers are discussed, along with a dissection of the development of the crisis in Germany, as an example of ad hoc crisis management. Findings are interpreted as an analogue to climate change, suggesting that our common interest should be to put every possible effort into mitigation and the avoidance of a {$>$} 1.5 {$^\circ$}C future.},

Meeting these challenges requires the development and approval of non-standard design and technical solutions. Based on the analysis of four case studies in the German context, we show how the creation of exceptional architecture requires that built environment professionals actively negotiate with established norms and standards in various ways. The learning processes thus enabled are contradictory. On the one hand, knowledge gained in the process of developing innovative solutions remains exclusive and, often, codification and standardization do not occur. On the other hand, in some instances, standards and norms are adapted to inform and guide other projects. In conclusion, this paper argues, norms and standards constitute a contested terrain and are characterized by a contradictory performativity. This paper thus advances wider debates on innovation in the building industry by highlighting the extreme tensions and ambivalent trade-offs that exist between the development of unique and tailor-made solutions for singular buildings and the investment in the standardization of novel products for the built environment.},

BPS-Statistics Indonesia has collected data related to tourism demand in Indonesia, but these data have different time period. Several data can be provided monthly, while the other data can be provided annually. However, accurate and real time tourism data are needed for effective policy making. In this era, all of information about tourism destination or accommodation can be gotten easily through internet, especially information from Google search engine, such as information about tourism places, flights, hotels, and ticket for tourism attractions. Since 2004, Google has provided the information of user behavior through Google Trends tool. This paper aims to analyze and compare the patterns of tourism demand in Indonesia from Google Trends data with tourism statistics from BPS-Statistics Indonesia. In order to understand tourism demand in Indonesia, we used Google Trends data on a set of queries related to tourism. This paper shows that the search intensity of related queries provides the pattern of predicted tourism demand in Indonesia. We evaluated the prediction result by comparing several time series models. Furthermore, we compared and correlated the Google Trends data with official data. The result shows that Google Trends data and tourism statistics have similar pattern when there were disasters. The result also shows that Google Trends data has correlation with official data and produced accurate prediction of tourism demand in Indonesia. Therefore, Google Trends data can be used to predict and understand the pattern of tourism demand in Indonesia.},

The debate on the so-called Bilbao effect showed that rundown industrial cities and regions might profit from culture-based development strategies, even if successful urban regeneration cannot be induced by only one flagship project without an appropriate local and regional context. Based on the comparative analysis of six, in general recently founded, museums in five countries (Guggenheim Museum Bilbao; Louvre in Lens; Centre Pompidou in Metz; Istanbul Modern Art Museum; Museum Folkwang in Essen; Museum of Natural History in Florence), the authors of this special issue discuss the role of these museums in building the image and the attractiveness of their local and regional environment, the cross-fertilization of ideas and the integration of a region in global circuits and networks. Museums can play an important role in building up ``social capital'', creating networks between different professionals, groups, sectors and segments of society, bridging diverse social backgrounds, lowering coordinating costs for individuals and businesses, and increasing the capacity of firms to reconnect.},

  abstract = {This work aims to investigate the impact of popular UNESCO World Heritage objects on the country's tourist arrivals as a factor of attractiveness, to estimate the strong correlation between these phenomena, and to mathematically validate the assumption that the number of such sites has a direct impact on the country's tourism competitiveness. We used data from the UNWTO's open sources, UNESCO, the World Economic Forum expert reports on the competitiveness of travels and tourism of the world's countries for 2017. The analysis is based on three rankings of countries in terms of World Heritage assets, international touristic arrivals and the country's tourism and travel competitiveness index, and correlation analysis between these values. Also, to determine the influence and interdependencies between the studied concepts, the method of paired correlation analysis was chosen as a convenient way to demonstrate the influence of one variable on another. Determination of the correlation coefficient allowed to speak about the complexity of the relationship and the linearity of these phenomena. In particular, the increase in the number of UNESCO World Heritage sites leads to an increase in tourist arrivals and makes the country attractive for tourism development. As a result, we have obtained estimates of the unidirectional impact of the number of World Heritage sites on the territory of a particular country on the volume of international tourist arrivals. However, not always the overall attractiveness and competitiveness of the country in the field of tourism is linked to the World Heritage, and our study only confirms the thesis that among the many ways to increase the attractiveness of the country, an increase in World Heritage sites leads to an increase in tourist traffic. In current trends, choosing public policy to enhance and preserve UNESCO sites one obviously can expect the growth of tourist flows to the countries.},

This study aims to address several objectives: (1) specify the best forecasting model in the prediction of tourist arrival volumes and tourism income for Turkey; (2) assess the degree of impact exerted by various determinants on the tourism forecasts; (3) generate forecasts for tourist arrival volumes and tourism income using the most suitable models; and (4) examine potential scenarios illustrating the ramifications of the Russia-Ukraine war on tourist arrival volumes and tourism income. The forecasting models employed in this study encompass a comprehensive set of statistical methods, including ETS, ARIMA, TRAMO-SEATS, X13, X11, STL, Grey, and their combinations with ANN. In the ANN models, exogenous variables such as the global financial crisis, the Turkey-Russia warplane crash crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and USD/TRY exchange rates are incorporated. The results unveil the identification of five superior models: ETS, Grey, hybrid ETS-ANN, hybrid Grey-ANN, and hybrid ARIMA-ANN models, which exhibit the lowest MAPE and sMAPE values. Forecasts for the forthcoming quarters are examined under two scenarios: assuming the continuity or cessation of the Russia-Ukraine war. Comparative analysis of the relative effects of exogenous variables indicates that COVID-19 has the most substantial impact on tourist arrival volumes, and tourism income is primarily influenced by the USD/TRY exchange rate.},

The proposed Bayesian synthetic control methods (BSCMs) do not impose any restrictive constraints on the parameter space a priori. Moreover, they provide statistical inference in a straightforward manner as well as a natural mechanism to deal with the ``large p, small n'' and sparsity problems through Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures. Using simulations, the authors find that for a variety of data-generating processes, the proposed BSCMs almost always provide better predictive accuracy and parameter precision than extant SCMs. They demonstrate an application of the proposed BSCMs to a real-world context of a tax imposed on soda sales in Washington state in 2010. As in the simulations, the proposed models outperform extant models, as measured by predictive accuracy in the posttreatment periods. The authors find that the tax led to an increase of 5.7\% in retail price and a decrease of 5.5\%*5.8\% in sales. They also find that retailers in Washington overshifted the tax to consumers, leading to a pass-through rate of approximately 121\%.},

To investigate the mechanisms of population decrease, we gathered administrative data on the universe of address changes and self-reported reasons for migration. While out-migration due to changes in the residential environment increased significantly, job-related migration showed little change. This out-migration also led to a depreciation in rental housing prices. Our results suggest that local residents perceived the earthquake as a negative amenity.},

In examining these cases, we found that places played three key roles: places contained, mediated, and complicated institutional work. Each of these roles was associated with a distinct ontology of place: places as social enclosures, as signifiers, and as practical objects. Our findings have significant implications for how we understand the relationship between location and organizations and allow us to develop a process model of places, institutions, and institutional work.},

Noncore areas lost 3--6 percent population; service employment declined 7 percent, whereas manufacturing employment increased by 21 percent. Municipalities within approximately 150 km of Tokyo expanded, while the distant ones contracted. The net result is that the Tokyo metropolitan area agglomerates because of HSR.},

About one quarter of respondents were less interested in travel in a COVID-adapted world than they were before the pandemic struck. They were a diverse group whose reasons for their reticence could be categorised into four broad risk groups of: ongoing anxiety; fear of catching the disease; satisfaction risk, and; travel risk as reflected by an overall loss of interest in travel. Each group displayed different COVID-adapted travel patterns that reflect the operationalisation of different risk categories. A follow-up survey conducted in August 2023 confirmed that up to one in four people still have less desire to travel as a result of COVID-19.},

In the paper I set out several layered narratives which try to capture the significance of this event for Basque political identity. After discussing issues of globalisation, political strategy and European territorial restructuring, I explore the following: first, the process of `McGuggenisation' and its consonance with ideas of global cultural imperialism; second, the `indigenisation' of the Guggenheim by the Basque political elite, a strategic engagement with globalisation; third, the contestation of the museum by particularist radicalism. In summary, the Guggenheim event is seen as a collision between Basque extremism, modernising `bourgeois regionalism', and the interests of a museum poised to become a global art corporation, providing a context for examining theories of globalisation in the European city.},

Findings revealed that disengagement was the main motivation to travel during this period. Three coping strategies were employed by travelers to overcome the crisis---engaging in growth, seeking strength, and hope and cautious optimism. Coping strategies employed by travelers enabled them to overcome the tensions experienced during the pandemic lockdown. These findings present a clear delineation of how travelers recover from the adversities of a pandemic crisis to travel again in its aftermath, thus contributing significantly to the tourism literature.},

Results found that total trip spending by strong geotravelers (US \$1164) was significantly higher than the overall spending of both moderate (US \$866) and minimal geotravelers (US \$668). These findings suggest that sustainable travelers are a travel market to be reckoned with in the tourism marketing and business world. The combination of their pro-sustainable behavior and increased spending provides evidence of a market segment in which destinations can benefit.},

  abstract = {This article analyses how creative entrepreneurs perceive the development of tourism; it looks at creative placemaking in tourism and reflects on the role of creative entrepreneurs in the sustainable development of tourism. To do so, we conducted semi-structured interviews with creative entrepreneurs in the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We choose a city in an early stage of tourism development but in a more advanced stage of culture-led urban regeneration. Although Rotterdam has a long history of strategies to change its image into a creative one, only recently has the city experienced an increase in media attention and a growing number of domestic and international tourists. This offers a unique opportunity to explore tourism development at an early stage. Our results nuance our understanding of the relations between creative entrepreneurs, placemaking, and tourism. Although the creative entrepreneurs in our sample consider themselves placemakers, issues such as equality, inclusiveness, and avoiding gentrification are still not adequately addressed. From a policy perspective, this study emphasises the need to take into account the fundamental question of whose city Rotterdam is and who benefits from the urban and tourism development strategy.},

Despite the ubiquity of this term, its validity is still debated. Furthermore, research on the topic has relied almost exclusively on individual or small-N comparative case studies. This paper builds on this research by testing the Bilbao effect through a quantitative analysis of 142 IADs completed in Canada and the United States between 2000 and 2009. Using fixed effects modelling, a method that controls for selection bias, the analysis examines the effect of IADs on a set of outcome variables that measure neighbourhoodlevel economic and cultural changes during this period: population, rent, the number of local arts establishments and the number of cultural workers living in the area. The analysis demonstrates that neighbourhoods with IADs generally experienced more economic and cultural growth than non-IAD neighbourhoods during this time period. However, the paper also complicates these findings by examining differences in how this growth manifests itself within emerging versus established neighbourhoods. These differences are illustrated through a comparison of the Dallas Arts District and Lincoln Square, Manhattan.},

Comprehension of residents' perceptions is crucial for realization of adequate tourism development and for mutual satisfaction of tourism demand and supply. Therefore, the aim is to test the model of residents' perceptions of economic, socio-cultural and environmental impacts of tourism on their (un)support for specific form of tourism development. To realize the purpose of this research, Cronbach alpha, explorative (EFC) and confirmatory (CFA) factor analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were applied. The findings indicate that there is a direct relationship between residents who perceive positive and negative economic, socio-cultural and environmental impacts of tourism and their (un)support for tourism development.

The first focused on the urban development and regeneration aspects and the success of the museum as a tourist magnet and an image-making device. The second perspective concentrated on the direct economic benefits of the museum, i.e. direct returns and effects on the economy. The missing lens in previous analyses, however, was the impact of the museum on the city's art landscape, including the art support activities. In this context, the article describes for the first time in a detailed way how the GMB has contributed to the shaping and propulsion of changes on commercial and non-profit art spaces in Bilbao. Although it is clear that other factors may play a role, it can be asserted that the effects of the museum are not only limited to an increase in tourism or fiscal return, but also contribute to the development and spatial articulation of the local art scene and public support of the arts.},

Analyzing 16 Italian WHSs, we show the most relevant trends in hospitality demand, comparing tourism flows at destinations before and after listing. Data show that, on average, growth rates of tourism demand in the 5 years after WHS listing are not higher than growth rates in the 5 years before the listing, but a number of different patterns emerge. The policy and managerial implications of such findings are straightforward: at least for a mature destination like Italy, there is no statistical evidence that WHS listing is associated with accelerating market growth rates.},

While generating tourist expenditure is not the aim of most architects, many are increasingly aware that articulated and functional buildings become visitor attractions in their own right -- an externality that requires valuing. However, the value assigned to iconic architecture is often restricted to the bricks and mortar construction, and the broader contributions a building can deliver to its stakeholders are largely ignored. This article explores the capacity for architecture to attract tourists and effect direct tourism spend through the examination of five cases, each of which has attempted to estimate their economic value to tourism. This article proposes a model for estimating the future value of iconic buildings and tests its application to the University of Technology Sydney, Gehry-designed, Dr Chau Chak Wing building. The implications of the framework and future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Culture and tourism have always been related, but with blurred interpretations of the empirical relationship between those phenomena. This paper estimates the impact of different cultural indicators on tourism development in 27 EU member states for the period 2008--2018, by using dynamic panel data. The results indicate that the number of UNESCO Heritage Sites do not have a significant influence on the number of tourism overnights, whereas there are significant positive effects on international tourism receipts and tourism employment. Moreover, the additional cultural sector specifics considered in the analysis; government expenditure on culture and employment in culture, showed to have a significant positive influence on all three tourism indicators used in the research. In addition, the research results indicate that the real GDP per capita and the level of human capital are significant drivers of tourism development.},

In our paper, we argue for understanding the developments between March 2020 and September 2021 as a (temporary) transformation within city tourism. To support this argument, we discuss the three dimensions of our conceptualization of ``new urban tourism'' (Stors et al., 2019) -- (a) the extraordinary mundane; (b) encounters and contact zones; and (c) urban co-production -- in the context of the pandemic. We illustrate that urban tourism still persists during strict travel bans, but is shaped by other city users, attributions, and practices. Thus, we argue that urban tourism is inherent to the city, also in times of a pandemic.},

In this paper, we instead propose estimating a common set of weights across outcomes, by balancing either a vector of all outcomes or an index or average of them. Under a low-rank factor model, we show that these approaches lead to lower bias bounds than separate weights, and that averaging leads to further gains when the number of outcomes grows. We illustrate this via a re-analysis of the impact of the Flint water crisis on educational outcomes.},

This study evaluates the effects of film industry on tourism outcomes in Dubrovnik, Croatia. Using the synthetic control approach, we estimate the causal effect of a highly broadcasted TV series, Game of Thrones, on tourist arrivals. The use of such a data-driven procedure is an important step towards identification-based empirical work in tourism research as it enables us to build a credible synthetic counterfactual and to answer the ``what if'' type of questions. We find a robust and positive effect of filming the TV series in Dubrovnik on the number of tourist arrivals. Additionally, we show that there are positive spillover effects on other counties and the whole country. Placebo tests show that the estimated effects are relatively large when compared to other counties implying our results are not driven simply by chance.},

While the existing literature has already established the negative impact of terrorist actions on international tourism in a particular region, this paper aims to determine whether ETA's final ceasefire and definitive dissolution had a positive impact on domestic tourism in Basque Country. To that end, a directed gravity model is estimated over a panel data-set of 699 domestic tourist flows between the Spanish regions from 2008 to 2013. Results suggest that the negative impact on visitor flows was localized in the Basque Country. Also, regardless of a permanent ceasefire announced in 2010, only the 2011 `definitive cessation of violence' had an immediate significant impact on the number of visitors to the Basque Country. These results complement the scarce literature on post-conflict tourism analysis and may have implications for regional authorities in affected regions in their efforts to rebuild their destination brands.},

The estimated impacts are compared with the economy-wide negative impacts of the pandemic via domestic and international tourism, to understand the potential level of compensation of domestic tourism promotion. The industry-level analysis indicates Dutch disease effects due to the decline in international tourism. A hypothetical boom in domestic tourism benefits non-tradable sectors to a significant level. Aggregate level analysis indicates a potential for economic gains through domestic tourism promotion, though such gains are inadequate to fully offset the foregone economic benefits due to loss in international tourism.},

Uncertainty surrounding Brexit, geopolitical and trade tensions, and the global economic slowdown, weighed on growth. 2019 was also the year of major shifts in the sector with the collapse of travel group Thomas Cook and several low-cost airlines in Europe. All regions enjoyed an increase in arrivals in 2019, led by the Middle East (+8\%). Asia and the Pacific and Europe both saw 4\% growth. Against a backdrop of global economic slowdown, tourism spending continued to grow, most notably among the world's top ten spenders. France reported the strongest increase in international tourism expenditure among the world's top ten outbound markets (+11\%), while the United States of America led growth in absolute terms (+USD 8 billion).},

Meta-regression results reveal several factors explaining the effect size of WHS status on tourism demand, such as the research period, level of development in the destination country, heritage type, dyadic data type, WHS endowment measure, and use of robust standard error.

The city of Hamburg, Germany, is currently investing {\texteuro}575 million in order to build a new symphony hall (Elbphilharmonie), {\texteuro}400 million to develop the `International Architectural Fair' and it is also considering candidature again for the `Olympic Games' in 2024/2028. As assessing the image effects of such projects is rather difficult, this article introduces an improved version of the Brand Concept Map approach, which was originally developed for product brands. An experimental design was used to first measure the Hamburg brand as such and then the changes in the brand perceptions after priming the participants (N = 209) for one of the three different flagship projects. The findings reveal several important structural differences for the brand image dimensions of the city contingent upon the type of flagship project. Hence, this study shows (i) that different flagship projects have different image effects for the city brand and (ii) provides a novel method for measuring perceived place brand image effects of both ongoing and future flagship projects.},
